- Hi, I’m @LibertasMater
- I’m interested in Learning as much as possible so I can make programs that solve problems that my end users didn't know they had.
- I’m currently learning Python3.10, and I'd like to learn Rust and MATLAB. I used to only learn Human to Human communication languages, but machines being 
very dumb, programming languages are a lot simpler. I could say more in python after the first 2 days than I could in Japanese after the first 2 weeks. English 
is my mother tongue, I'm fairly understanding of Spanish and Nynorsk, and I'm reasonably fluent in conversational casual Japanese. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on a reddit bot that foils attempts to prosletyze. 
- How to reach me: I'm not 100% sure how github works, but I'm reasonably sure they have a message function. Use that if it exists. Otherwise, I'm
u/NutmegLover on reddit. You can get ahold of me there too. 
- My ultimate goal is to land a job as a software engineer. Toward that end I'm giving myself a homeschool education in Computer Science through the 
Open Source Society University curriculum, and additional resources from the Library and on youtube (Largely the extras are for learning the extra material
that is of interest to me, such as Rust, MATLAB, and some basic Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.) I'm also giving myself some gen ed courses to round out
the education. It is things like "The History of Post-Colonial Africa" and "Quebecois French Vocabulary".
